                Abstract: In this paper, a wearable, wireless system is demonstrated using electromyography (EMG) signals for real-time control of a smartphone device. The system allows gesture-based control of a smartphone or tablet computer without physical contact, direct line of sight, or significant movement. Additionally, automated gesture detection is shifted to the smartphone, eliminating the need for robust computing hardware. The electronic system and gesture prediction algorithm are described, and measured results are presented and for multiple users. The system demonstrates a maximum true positive detection rate of 92\% for a trained user, using three distinct hand gestures. The EMG-based detection system serves as a proof-of-concept for providing wireless, gesture-based control of computer interfaces using low-cost consumer hardware.

                This project began as a senior design project under Dr. Matthew Johnston in Fall 2017. I contributed to the hardware design and physical design components. I also acted as the project manager for our team.

                <h2>ROS Wiki: Past, Present, and Future</h2>
                <p>
		ROS relies on having accessible, high quality, up-to-date documentation, and the wiki has served this need for many years.  However, due to a combination of aging technology, a changing ecosystem, and a growing audience, it no longer satisfactorily achieves this goal. This project looked to present an in-depth analysis of the current wiki based on five years of analytics data, discuss how an updated wiki fits into the larger ecosystem of ROS documentation, and looked to unveil a modernized, backwards-compatible MediaWiki-based migration of the current wiki for community feedback. This was part of an NSF funded project.

		In collaboration with the <a href="https://health.oregonstate.edu/gobabygo" target="_blank">Go Baby Go Project</a> in OSU's Social Mobility Lab, I designed, built, and evaluated a system for data collection to track use of a modified commercial Ride-On Car for children with developmental hindrances. Additionally I collected data which has been processed into an Honors College Thesis.

                <h2>Human Compliance with Telepresence Robots in Medical Scenarios</h2>
                <p>
		Status: In progress

                <p>
		This research is central to my Masters thesis as part of the Personal Robotics Group. I am looking to measure the difference in compliance between a person who is instructed by a human wearing Ebola-style PPE compared to a telepresence robot with a human controller. This research hopes to determine if using a telepresence robot achieves the same level of compliance with the patient so it can be determined if this style of care can be used in infectous disease scenarios, such as Ebola, to reduce risk of disease spread to caregivers. This research is funded by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
