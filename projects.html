                Abstract: When treating highly infectious diseases, patient compliance with caregiver recommendations is crucial. Many patients who contract Ebola Virus Disease have symptoms including vomiting and severe diarrhea and die from the resulting dehydration if they do not drink enough fluids. Telepresence robots are useful in the context of Ebola treatment for performing patient interactions without further risk of contamination to care providers. As part of this Masters thesis, a study was conducted to determine if there is a difference in compliance when an individual is directed by someone using a telepresence robot compared to when they are directed by someone wearing Ebola-style personal protective equipment (PPE). This work is relevant to the compliance of patients in the treatment of Ebola for simple tasks such as reminding patients to eat and drink water where telepresence robots may be a suitable replacement for healthcare workers in the role of Ebola patient supervisor or supporter. Simple tasks are important to the survival of Ebola patients, who often perish from dehydration, and can be easily accomplished using a telepresence robot, whereas changed IV fluid or other medical tasks cannot be. The results show that there was no statistically significant difference between the subject group instructed by the person in the Ebola PPE and the subject group instructed by the person using the telepresence robot by performing single factor ANOVAs on the resulting data. Based on these results telepresence robots may be able to replace physically present healthcare workers for some tasks.

                Abstract: In this paper, a wearable, wireless system is demonstrated using electromyography (EMG) signals for real-time control of a smartphone device. The system allows gesture-based control of a smartphone or tablet computer without physical contact, direct line of sight, or significant movement. Additionally, automated gesture detection is shifted to the smartphone, eliminating the need for robust computing hardware. The electronic system and gesture prediction algorithm are described, and measured results are presented and for multiple users. The system demonstrates a maximum true positive detection rate of 92\% for a trained user, using three distinct hand gestures. The EMG-based detection system serves as a proof-of-concept for providing wireless, gesture-based control of computer interfaces using low-cost consumer hardware.

                This project began as a senior design project under Dr. Matthew Johnston in Fall 2017. I contributed to the hardware design and physical design components. I also acted as the project manager for our team.

                <p>
		ROS relies on having accessible, high quality, up-to-date documentation, and the wiki has served this need for many years.  However, due to a combination of aging technology, a changing ecosystem, and a growing audience, it no longer satisfactorily achieves this goal. This project looked to present an in-depth analysis of the current wiki based on five years of analytics data, discuss how an updated wiki fits into the larger ecosystem of ROS documentation, and looked to unveil a modernized, backwards-compatible MediaWiki-based migration of the current wiki for community feedback. This was part of an NSF funded project.

		In collaboration with the <a href="https://health.oregonstate.edu/gobabygo" target="_blank">Go Baby Go Project</a> in OSU's Social Mobility Lab, I designed, built, and evaluated a system for data collection to track use of a modified commercial Ride-On Car for children with developmental hindrances. Additionally I collected data which has been processed into an Honors College Thesis.
