                <h2>Patient Compliance Effects on Simulated Ebola Medical Care Delivery with a Telepresence Robot</h2>

                Abstract: When treating highly infectious diseases, patient compliance with caregiver recommendations is crucial. Many patients who contract Ebola Virus Disease have symptoms including vomiting and severe diarrhea and die from the resulting dehydration if they do not drink enough fluids. Telepresence robots are useful in the context of Ebola treatment for performing patient interactions without further risk of contamination to care providers. As part of this Masters thesis, a study was conducted to determine if there is a difference in compliance when an individual is directed by someone using a telepresence robot compared to when they are directed by someone wearing Ebola-style personal protective equipment (PPE). This work is relevant to the compliance of patients in the treatment of Ebola for simple tasks such as reminding patients to eat and drink water where telepresence robots may be a suitable replacement for healthcare workers in the role of Ebola patient supervisor or supporter. Simple tasks are important to the survival of Ebola patients, who often perish from dehydration, and can be easily accomplished using a telepresence robot, whereas changed IV fluid or other medical tasks cannot be. The results show that there was no statistically significant difference between the subject group instructed by the person in the Ebola PPE and the subject group instructed by the person using the telepresence robot by performing single factor ANOVAs on the resulting data. Based on these results telepresence robots may be able to replace physically present healthcare workers for some tasks.

                <h2>Wireless Smartphone Control using Electromyography and Automated Gesture Recognition</h2>

                Abstract: In this paper, a wearable, wireless system is demonstrated using electromyography (EMG) signals for real-time control of a smartphone device. The system allows gesture-based control of a smartphone or tablet computer without physical contact, direct line of sight, or significant movement. Additionally, automated gesture detection is shifted to the smartphone, eliminating the need for robust computing hardware. The electronic system and gesture prediction algorithm are described, and measured results are presented and for multiple users. The system demonstrates a maximum true positive detection rate of 92% for a trained user, using three distinct hand gestures. The EMG-based detection system serves as a proof-of-concept for providing wireless, gesture-based control of computer interfaces using low-cost consumer hardware.

                Abstract: Research into smart wheelchairs has been conducted for decades, but we have yet to see the widespread use of this technology among full-time wheelchair users. We argue that the main reason for this is that there is a mismatch between research and the actualities of using a powered mobility device in the real world. Based on our own research experiences, we enumerate some of these disparities, and offer some suggestions for where work in smart wheelchairs might focus in the coming years.

                <h2>Design and Implementation of a Ride-On Car with Data Tracking for Use by Young Children with Developmental Differences</h2>

                Abstract: This work describes the design and modification of a commercial childrenâ€™s ride-on car to effectively collect usage data. The design is cheap and could be easily modified to gather more information. This will serve as a viable way to collect information about how motorized independence can help children with developmental differences. Children with developmental differences do not develop the same level of social, language, and cognitive skills as other children without mobility limitations. There is growing evidence that suggests the frequent use of a ride-on car (ROC) may help increase these skills. The increased mobility and independence that the ROC provides has been shown to do so in a few specific cases, although there have been no large-scale studies on these effects. Many children with developmental differences do not have access to affordable wheelchairs through insurance until they are at least 3 years of age. For many developmental skills, this is too late. Studies have shown that short-term ROC use for these children is feasible. This work seeks to explore one option to take data that could be correlated to improvements in fundamental movement skills for such studies in a cost-effective manner.
